Description

Compilation of my solutions to cryptography-related challenges that I find interesting. Each challenge directory will contain a `README` file explaining the problem statement, build instruction, and solution approach.

Don't hesitate to reach out if my solution is confusing or needs a better explanation. In the future, I will write a blog about a few of my solutions (not my top priority at the moment).

### 1. Bitcoin flavoured Crypto Challenges
> Here's a Bitcoin-flavored cryptography challenge in the spirit of Cryptopals --by Elliot Jin ([@robot_dreams](https://twitter.com/robot__dreams))

- [Challenge 1](./challenge01/README.md): Nonce reuse in schnorr signatures
- [Challenge 2](./challenge02/README.md): Schnorr signatures using Linear Congruential PRNG
- [Challenge 3](./challenge03/README.md): Rogue key attack on insecure multi-signature scheme
- [Challenge 4](./challenge04/README.md): Shamir Secret Sharing

Gratitude

I am very grateful to my mentor [Jesse Posner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesseposner/) for helping me understand daunting cryptographic schemes. I learned so many interesting cryptographic concepts from our weekly meetings.

A huge shout out to [Elliot Jin](https://twitter.com/robot__dreams) for helping me come up with a solution for the [challenge 3](./challenge03/README.md).
